                My name is Jessen Dasilva and I am 22 years old living in Waterloo, Ontario.
                I currently work part-time for a data cleansing company called IMA building and redesigning their current website.
                Most of what the company does is it takes companies inventory of parts and materials and standarizes it against a set of strict and
                modern organization techniques to create a uniform and standarized inventory. We have just recently dove straight into the tech startup world
                developing an in-house app to aid the current data cleansers in increasing throughput and overall prodcutivity. 

               <p id="aboutParagraph"> One of my many passions include playing hockey (you have to atleast know how to skate to call
                yourself a canadian) and playing the occasional new video game thats been released, going on hikes and just being advenurous.
                I have one younger brother (21) named Josh and one interesting fact about us is that we dont look much
                alike to the point where people dont believe us when we say that we are related to eachother.
               </p>

                I am a driven induvidual who strives to perfection, efficiency and attention to detail. I love working in groups and collaborating 
                with others because you are able to expose yourself to others unique and creative ways of thinking that in turn help broaden and expand
                my own knowledge. I love learning new things and collaboraive environments with where my strengths shine. 

                One of my weaknesses is speaking or presenting ideas infront of large groups ad speaking up in group discussions to either debate or express my
                own opinons of thoughts about a specified subject.
